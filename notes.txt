I'm thinking we'll tell a story, particularly showing how the dome is assembled, with the fully assembled dome in the center with the vehicle (SUV) with trailer and components on it. So around the perimeter, we'll have domes in the process of being constructed to demonstrate how it's pulled together, and in the center is the fully assembled dome, with furnishings, interior.

Some comments on how to apply a mesh to a .glb file.

So pretty straightforward adding a mesh, as a child of the .obj file. As for .glb files, apparently they have to be dug into more to apply the mesh. Otherwise, it's quite straightforward.
